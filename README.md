# Windows Setup Checklist

This is a collection of small tasks that I always like to complete when I start fresh on a new Windows installation.

Obviously this is subject to personal taste, but there might be a thing or two you like and forget to do on this list! This list was written with Windows 7+ in mind. Some common setup tasks are skipped because I partially made this while considering my work computer, which has some things already done.
